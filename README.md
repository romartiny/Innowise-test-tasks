Write a function that finds how many Mondays occurred on the first day of each month in the period from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1999. Your function should return Mondays count and the date when this Monday occurred and print value to the console. Each value should be placed on the new line and dates should have format DD.MM.YYYY. Try to implement the most optimized version of the function.

input: 1980, 2000, 02, 04
output: 35
